      <description>&lt;p&gt;When do you conduct an ANOVA? You conduct an ANOVA when you are testing the effect of one or more nominal (aka factor) independent variable(s) on a numerical dependent variable. A nominal (factor) variable is one that contains a finite number of categories with no inherent order. Gender, profession, experimental conditions, and Justin Bieber albums are good examples of factors (not necessarily of good music). If you only include one independent variable, this is called a One-way ANOVA. If you include two independent variables, this is called a Two-way ANOVA. If you include three independent variables it is called a Menage a trois `NOVA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok maybe it’s not yet, but we repeat it enough it will be and we can change the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let’s say you want to test how well each of three different cleaning fluids are at getting poop off of your poop deck.To test this, you could do the following: over the course of 300 cleaning days, you clean different areas of the deck with the three different cleaners. You then record how long it takes for each cleaner to clean its portion of the deck. At the same time, you could also measure how well the cleaner is cleaning two different types of poop that typically show up on your deck: shark and parrot. Here, your independent variables cleaner and type are factors, and your dependent variable time is numeric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, this experiment has already been conducted. The data are recorded in a dataframe called poopdeck in the yarrr package. Here’s how the first few rows of the data look:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Metabolomics and proteomics, like other omics domains, usually face a data mining challenge in providing an understandable output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Often, statistical analysis is one of the most difficult challenges and it is critical in the subsequent biological interpretation of the results. Because of this, combined with the computational programming skills needed for this type of analysis, several bioinformatic tools aimed at simplifying metabolomics and proteomics data analysis have emerged. However, sometimes the analysis is still limited to a few hidebound statistical methods and to data sets with limited flexibility. POMAShiny is a web-based tool that provides a structured, flexible and user-friendly workflow for the visualization, exploration and statistical analysis of metabolomics and proteomics data. This tool integrates several statistical methods, some of them widely used in other types of omics, and it is based on the POMA R/Bioconductor package, which increases the reproducibility and flexibility of analyses outside the web environment. POMAShiny and POMA are both freely available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nutrimetabolomics/POMAShiny&#34;&gt;https://github.com/nutrimetabolomics/POMAShiny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nutrimetabolomics/POMA,&#34;&gt;https://github.com/nutrimetabolomics/POMA,&lt;/a&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FOBI: An ontology to represent food intake data and associate it with metabolomic data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nutrition research can be conducted by using two complementary approaches: (i) traditional self-reporting methods or (ii) via metabolomics techniques to analyze food intake biomarkers in biofluids. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of these two very different types of data often hinder their analysis and integration. To manage this challenge, we have developed a novel ontology that describes food and their associated metabolite entities in a hierarchical way. This ontology uses a formal naming system, category definitions, properties and relations between both types of data. The ontology presented is called FOBI (Food-Biomarker Ontology) and it is composed of two interconnected sub-ontologies. One is a ’Food Ontology’ consisting of raw foods and ‘multi-component foods’ while the second is a ‘Biomarker Ontology’ containing food intake biomarkers classified by their chemical classes. These two sub-ontologies are conceptually independent but interconnected by different properties. This allows data and information regarding foods and food biomarkers to be visualized in a bidirectional way, going from metabolomics to nutritional data or vice versa. Potential applications of this ontology include the annotation of foods and biomarkers using a well-defined and consistent nomenclature, the standardized reporting of metabolomics workflows (e.g. metabolite identification, experimental design) or the application of different enrich- ment analysis approaches to analyze nutrimetabolomic data. Availability: FOBI is freely available in both OWL (Web Ontology Language) and OBO (Open Biomedical Ontolo- gies) formats at the project’s Github repository (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/FoodBiomarkerOntology&#34;&gt;https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/FoodBiomarkerOntology&lt;/a&gt;) and FOBI visualization tool is available in &lt;a href=&#34;https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/FOBI_Visualization_Tool/&#34;&gt;https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/FOBI_Visualization_Tool/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;En COVID-19 el pronóstico vital viene determinado, entre otros factores, por el grado hiperinflamación
inducido por la infección por SARS-CoV-2. Disponer de buenos marcadores iniciales para pronosticar el desarrollo
de esta hiperinflamación puede resultar de gran utilidad para el cribado y el inicio de tratamiento con
inmunoduladores. Para identificar el valor pronostico de los distintos marcadores de laboratorio en uso hemos
analizado datos demográficos y 32 parámetros de laboratorio en relación con el resultado final 1292 enfermos
mayores de 18 años (716 V y 576 M) no tratados que acudieron a urgencias entre el 11/03 y 26/05 2020. Se
confirmó que la edad es el factor que más influye en el pronóstico, alta a domicilio, edad media 54,114,8 frente a
fallecimiento 74,3 10,8 con una p corregida &amp;lt;0,001 por lo que en los modelos predictivos se mantuvo la edad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Los datos se han analizado mediante la aplicación web Covid Explorer basada en R y Shiny desarrollada por los
autores &lt;a href=&#34;http://uebshiny.vhir.org:3838/shiny_covid19/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://uebshiny.vhir.org:3838/shiny_covid19/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El grado de asociación de los marcadores de laboratorio analizados mediante t-test sigue la siguiente jerarquía.
IL-6 (log) &amp;gt; Proteína C reactiva (log) &amp;gt; linfocitos (%) &amp;gt; urea &amp;gt; neutrófilos (%) &amp;gt; D-Dímero (log) &amp;gt; linfocitos (n) &amp;gt; ratio
neutrófilo/linfocito (NLR) &amp;gt; Hb &amp;gt; neutrófilos (n) &amp;gt; ferritina (log) &amp;gt; tpo protrombina INR. La primera componente del
análisis de componentes principales explica el 24,8% de la variabilidad total de los datos y sugiere que las variables
que más peso tienen en el resultado “alta a domicilio” son la cifra total de linfocitos y en el de “fallecimiento”, el
número total de neutrófilos, la IL-6, la proteína C reactiva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La aplicación del modelo predictivo lasso dio para las variables, antes enumerados más fibrinógeno, una precisión
por encima de 0.85. Estos datos validan estudios previos en grupos menores y demuestran la posibilidad de
generar modelos predictivos bastante precisos en el momento inicial, para lo cual convendría, probablemente,
incluir más datos que miden el estado hiperinflamatorio inicial de estos enfermos.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Similarly to other high-throughput technologies, metabolomics usually faces a data mining challenge to provide an understandable and useful output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Biological interpretation of the results is one of the hard points and several bioinformatics tools have emerged to simplify and improve this step. However, sometimes these tools accept only very simplistic data structures and, for example, they do not even accept data with several covariates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POMA is a free, friendly and fast Shiny interface for analysing and visualization data after an analytical targeted metabolomics process and its hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/POMA/&#34;&gt;https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/POMA/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POMA allows the user to go from the raw data to statistical analysis. The analysis is organized in three blocks: “Load Data” (where user can upload metabolite data and a covariates file), “Pre-processing” (value imputation and normalization) and “Statistical analysis” (univariate and multivariate methods, limma, correlation analysis, feature selection methods, random forest, etc.). These steps include multiple types of interactive data visualization integrated in an intuitive user interface that requires no programming skills. Finally, POMA also generates different automatic statistical and exploratory reports to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigenome-wide association study in Childhood Obesity: Searching for early markers of late disease risk</title>
      <link>/talk/epimet2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2019 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>/talk/epimet2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale&lt;/strong&gt;: Childhood obesity is one a major Public Health
issue. Overweight/obese children have a high risk of being
obese as adults and develop other co-morbidities, including type
2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer.
It has been proposed that epigenetic mechanisms might be
involved in mediating long-term metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;: Here we analyzed DNA methylation profiles (Infinium
MethylationEPIC BeadChip, 850K) in whole blood from 26
obese (zBMI &amp;gt; 2) and 12 control lean pre-pubertal children
(zBMI &amp;lt; 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;:109 CpG sites appeared differentially methylated
between the two groups (methylation change 10% and FDR
value &amp;lt;0.05). 5 out of the 109 targets, were located within the
SPATC1L (Spermatogenesis and Centriole Associated 1 Like)
gene. Next, we performed a Two Sample Mendelian
Randomization test, and found that 2 of the 5 CpG sites
mapping the SPATC1L locus are causal for multiple disorders,
including childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, ulcerative colitis
and inflammatory bowel disease. SPATC1L expression was
similar in whole blood of obese and lean subjects. However, the
contiguous genes COL6A2 and COL6A3 (Collagen Type VI
Alpha 2 and 3 Chains), which are strongly associated to obesity,
were differentially expressed between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;: Childhood obesity is associated to a small change
in DNA methylation (109 CpG sites). In our dataset, only 2 CpG
sites appeared to play a causative role in the development of
the disease. We hypothesize that these CpG sites might
mediate disease risk by modulating the expression of physically
close genes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FBOnto: An ontology to represent food intake data and associate it with metabolomic data</title>
      <link>/talk/jbg2018/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, nutrition research generates a lot of complex data hard to analyze and associate with other data or omics such as metabolomics. By itself, metabolomics is closely linked to nutrition. However, it is still difficult to associate these two types of data. One reason for this difficulty is the heterogeneity found in the information provided by participants in nutritional studies about what they have eaten. In order to
manage this heterogeneity we have decide to build an ontology, describing foods in a
hierarchichal way that enables a common description of food intake. This ontology
contains formal naming, definition of the categories, properties, and relations
between the concepts of two types of data, food and related metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ontology has been created using Protégé 5.2.0 version. As is common in
ontologies, FBOnto (Food-Biomarker Ontology) has been written in OWL language (Web
Ontology Language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ontology presented is called FBOnto and is made of two sub-ontologies. The first
ontology describes foods: from simple such as fruits and vegetables to more complex
foods such as ratatouille. The second ontology describes metabolites, grouped in their
different chemical classes. The nodes or elements of these two sub-ontologies are
connected by the properties of each one, so that if a metabolite is in different foods, it
will connect with all of them. This ontology allows us to visualize data in a
bidirectional way, going from metabolomics to nutritional data or vice versa. In
addition, this ontology can also be useful for other analyses such as enrichment analysis
or a novel concept, food-enrichment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lifestyle intervention decreases urine trimethylamine N-oxide levels in prepubertal children with obesity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; Early lifestyle interventions in children with obesity decrease risk of future obesity
and metabolic disorders. However, the metabolic effects of such interventions are not
completely characterized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; We analyzed the impact of lifestyle intervention in the urine metabolome from
prepubertal children. We studied 34 prepubertal children with obesity before and after a 6-
month-long lifestyle intervention program. We applied a nuclear magnetic resonance approach
to obtain the metabolomic profile from urine samples. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant
Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to achieve group classification and variable importance on
projection (VIP) for biomarker selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; The intervention reduced caloric intake by 10% (p&amp;lt;0.05) and BMI-SDS by 0.47 SD
(p&amp;lt;0.001). PLS-DA identified trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO, VIP=2.21) as the metabolite with
the highest discrimination properties between groups. Urine TMAO levels were reduced after
the intervention (p&amp;lt;0.05). TMAO is a biomarker of cardiovascular disease risk and is a product
of gut microbiota-dependent metabolism of certain dietary compounds, including choline.
Notably, changes in TMAO levels after the intervention did not correlate to differences in choline
intake but were inversely associated with fiber intake (p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; Our results indicate that TMAO levels are decreased by lifestyle intervention in
children with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigenome-wide association study in childhood obesity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Childhood obesity is one a major Public Health issue. Overweight/obese children have a
high risk of being obese as adults and develop other co-morbidities, including type 2
diabetes, cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer. It has been proposed that
epigenetic mechanisms might be involved in mediating long-term metabolic
dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we analyzed DNA methylation profiles (Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip
850K) in whole blood from 26 obese (zBMI &amp;gt; 2) and 12 control lean pre-pubertal
children (zBMI &amp;lt; 1). 109 CpG sites appeared differentially methylated between the two
groups (methylation change &amp;gt;10% and FDR value &amp;lt;0.05). 5 out of the 109 targets, were
located within the SPATC1L (Spermatogenesis and Centriole Associated 1 Like) gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we performed a Two Sample Mendelian Randomization test, which allows
determining whether a particular CpG site is causal or consequence for the disease.
Strikingly, we found that 2 of the 5 CpG sites mapping the SPATC1L locus are causal for
multiple disorders, including not only childhood obesity, but also type 2
diabetes, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease. SPATC1L expression was
similar in whole blood of obese and lean subjects. However, the contiguous
genes COL6A2 (Collagen Type VI Alpha 2 Chain), LSS (Lanosterol Synthase), YBEY (YbeY
Metallopeptidase) and C21orf58 were differentially expressed between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, we show that childhood obesity is associated to a small change in DNA
methylation (109 CpG sites). In our dataset, only 2 CpG sites appeared to play a
causative role in the development of the disease. We hypothesize that these CpG sites
might mediate disease risk by modulating the expression of physically close genes.&lt;/p&gt;
