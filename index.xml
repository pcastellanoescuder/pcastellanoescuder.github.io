      <title>FOBI: An ontology to represent food intake data and associate it with metabolomic data</title>
      <link>/talk/fobi_metabomeeting2020/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nutrition research can be conducted by using two complementary approaches: 1) traditional self-reporting methods or 2) via metabolomics techniques to analyze food intake biomarkers in biofluids. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of these two very different types of data often hinder their analysis and integration. To manage this challenge, we have developed a novel ontology that describes food and their associated metabolite entities in a hierarchical way. This ontology uses a formal naming system, category definitions, properties and relations between both types of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ontology presented is called FOBI (Food-Biomarker Ontology) and it is composed of two interconnected sub-ontologies. One is a ”Food Ontology” consisting of raw foods and prepared foods while the second is a ”Biomarker Ontology” containing food intake biomarkers classified by their chemical classes. These two sub-ontologies are conceptually independent but interconnected by different properties. This allows data and information regarding foods and food biomarkers to be visualized in a bidirectional way, going from metabolomics to nutritional data or vice versa. Potential applications of this ontology include the annotation of foods and biomarkers using a well-defined and consistent nomenclature, the standardized reporting of metabolomics workflows (e.g. metabolite identification, experimental design), or the application of different enrichment analysis approaches to analyze nutrimetabolomic data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Similarly to other high-throughput technologies, metabolomics usually faces a data mining challenge to provide an understandable and useful output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Biological interpretation of the results is one of the hard points and several bioinformatics tools have emerged to simplify and improve this step. However, sometimes these tools accept only very simplistic data structures and, for example, they do not even accept data with several covariates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POMA is a free, friendly and fast Shiny interface for analysing and visualization data after an analytical targeted metabolomics process and its hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/POMA/&#34;&gt;https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/POMA/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POMA allows the user to go from the raw data to statistical analysis. The analysis is organized in three blocks: “Load Data” (where user can upload metabolite data and a covariates file), “Pre-processing” (value imputation and normalization) and “Statistical analysis” (univariate and multivariate methods, limma, correlation analysis, feature selection methods, random forest, etc.). These steps include multiple types of interactive data visualization integrated in an intuitive user interface that requires no programming skills. Finally, POMA also generates different automatic statistical and exploratory reports to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigenome-wide association study in Childhood Obesity: Searching for early markers of late disease risk</title>
      <link>/talk/epimet-talk/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>/talk/epimet-talk/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale&lt;/strong&gt;: Childhood obesity is one a major Public Health
issue. Overweight/obese children have a high risk of being
obese as adults and develop other co-morbidities, including type
2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer.
It has been proposed that epigenetic mechanisms might be
involved in mediating long-term metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;: Here we analyzed DNA methylation profiles (Infinium
MethylationEPIC BeadChip, 850K) in whole blood from 26
obese (zBMI &amp;gt; 2) and 12 control lean pre-pubertal children
(zBMI &amp;lt; 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;:109 CpG sites appeared differentially methylated
between the two groups (methylation change 10% and FDR
value &amp;lt;0.05). 5 out of the 109 targets, were located within the
SPATC1L (Spermatogenesis and Centriole Associated 1 Like)
gene. Next, we performed a Two Sample Mendelian
Randomization test, and found that 2 of the 5 CpG sites
mapping the SPATC1L locus are causal for multiple disorders,
including childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, ulcerative colitis
and inflammatory bowel disease. SPATC1L expression was
similar in whole blood of obese and lean subjects. However, the
contiguous genes COL6A2 and COL6A3 (Collagen Type VI
Alpha 2 and 3 Chains), which are strongly associated to obesity,
were differentially expressed between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;: Childhood obesity is associated to a small change
in DNA methylation (109 CpG sites). In our dataset, only 2 CpG
sites appeared to play a causative role in the development of
the disease. We hypothesize that these CpG sites might
mediate disease risk by modulating the expression of physically
close genes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FBOnto: An ontology to represent food intake data and associate it with metabolomic data</title>
      <link>/talk/fbonto_bio-talk/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, nutrition research generates a lot of complex data hard to analyze and associate with other data or omics such as metabolomics. By itself, metabolomics is closely linked to nutrition. However, it is still difficult to associate these two types of data. One reason for this difficulty is the heterogeneity found in the information provided by participants in nutritional studies about what they have eaten. In order to
manage this heterogeneity we have decide to build an ontology, describing foods in a
hierarchichal way that enables a common description of food intake. This ontology
contains formal naming, definition of the categories, properties, and relations
between the concepts of two types of data, food and related metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ontology has been created using Protégé 5.2.0 version. As is common in
ontologies, FBOnto (Food-Biomarker Ontology) has been written in OWL language (Web
Ontology Language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ontology presented is called FBOnto and is made of two sub-ontologies. The first
ontology describes foods: from simple such as fruits and vegetables to more complex
foods such as ratatouille. The second ontology describes metabolites, grouped in their
different chemical classes. The nodes or elements of these two sub-ontologies are
connected by the properties of each one, so that if a metabolite is in different foods, it
will connect with all of them. This ontology allows us to visualize data in a
bidirectional way, going from metabolomics to nutritional data or vice versa. In
addition, this ontology can also be useful for other analyses such as enrichment analysis
or a novel concept, food-enrichment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lifestyle intervention decreases urine trimethylamine N-oxide levels in prepubertal children with obesity</title>
      <link>/publication/obesity_carles_2018/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 08 Jul 2018 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>/publication/obesity_carles_2018/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; Early lifestyle interventions in children with obesity decrease risk of future obesity
and metabolic disorders. However, the metabolic effects of such interventions are not
completely characterized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; We analyzed the impact of lifestyle intervention in the urine metabolome from
prepubertal children. We studied 34 prepubertal children with obesity before and after a 6-
month-long lifestyle intervention program. We applied a nuclear magnetic resonance approach
to obtain the metabolomic profile from urine samples. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant
Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to achieve group classification and variable importance on
projection (VIP) for biomarker selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; The intervention reduced caloric intake by 10% (p&amp;lt;0.05) and BMI-SDS by 0.47 SD
(p&amp;lt;0.001). PLS-DA identified trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO, VIP=2.21) as the metabolite with
the highest discrimination properties between groups. Urine TMAO levels were reduced after
the intervention (p&amp;lt;0.05). TMAO is a biomarker of cardiovascular disease risk and is a product
of gut microbiota-dependent metabolism of certain dietary compounds, including choline.
Notably, changes in TMAO levels after the intervention did not correlate to differences in choline
intake but were inversely associated with fiber intake (p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; Our results indicate that TMAO levels are decreased by lifestyle intervention in
children with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
