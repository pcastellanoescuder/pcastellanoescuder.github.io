&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are different types of ANOVA. And yes, they can give different outputs depending on the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANOVA is a widely used statistical method used to test the effect of one or more factorial variables (independent terms) on a continuous numerical variable (dependent term). This method aims to split the total variation of the dependent variable into one or more sources of variation using the Sum of Squares, and unveiling if independent variables have a significant effect on the dependent variable. There are three basic assumptions in ANOVA:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independence of samples&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The distribution of the residuals should be normal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Homocedasticity: homogeneity of the variances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of testing the effect of only one independent variable, we will be using the &lt;strong&gt;One-Way ANOVA&lt;/strong&gt;. However, if we want to test two independent variables, we will use the &lt;strong&gt;Two-Way ANOVA&lt;/strong&gt;. In the same way, if we want to test the effect of three or more factorial independent variables, we will call it &lt;strong&gt;X-Way ANOVA&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we want to assess the effects of diet and exercises on weight loss in 10 sedentary males. Fortunately, the data for this experiment can be found in the &lt;code&gt;datarium&lt;/code&gt; R package. Here, our factorial independent variables are &lt;code&gt;diet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;exercises&lt;/code&gt;, and our dependent numeric variable is the weight loss score measured at the end of each trial (&lt;code&gt;t3&lt;/code&gt;). For more info about the dataset see &lt;code&gt;?datarium::weightloss&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)
library(datarium)
data(weightloss)

head(weightloss)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# A tibble: 6 × 6
  id    diet  exercises    t1    t2    t3
  &amp;lt;fct&amp;gt; &amp;lt;fct&amp;gt; &amp;lt;fct&amp;gt;     &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
1 1     no    no         10.4 13.2   11.6
2 2     no    no         11.6 10.7   13.2
3 3     no    no         11.4 11.1   11.4
4 4     no    no         11.1  9.5   11.1
5 5     no    no          9.5  9.73  12.3
6 6     no    no          9.5 12.7   10.4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we can try to answer different questions given this dataset and the above concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;one-way-anova&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;One-Way ANOVA&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the effect of the &lt;code&gt;diet&lt;/code&gt; on the weight loss score without regard to &lt;code&gt;exercises&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(aov(t3 ~ diet, data = weightloss))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&amp;gt;F)
diet         1   0.09   0.091   0.017  0.895
Residuals   46 239.61   5.209               &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seems that &lt;code&gt;diet&lt;/code&gt; alone doesn’t have a significant effect on weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the effect of the &lt;code&gt;exercises&lt;/code&gt; on the weight loss score without regard to &lt;code&gt;diet&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(aov(t3 ~ exercises, data = weightloss))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the contrary, seems that &lt;code&gt;exercises&lt;/code&gt; have a significant effect on weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;two-way-anova&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Is there a &lt;strong&gt;unique&lt;/strong&gt; effect of the &lt;code&gt;diet&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;exercises&lt;/code&gt; on the weight loss score (&lt;code&gt;t3&lt;/code&gt;)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(aov(t3 ~ diet + exercises, data = weightloss))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given these results, there seems to be an effect of &lt;code&gt;exercises&lt;/code&gt; but not &lt;code&gt;diet&lt;/code&gt; on weight loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the effect of the &lt;code&gt;diet&lt;/code&gt; depend on the &lt;code&gt;exercises&lt;/code&gt;? Here we need an interaction term (&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;). Interaction effects represent the combined effects of factors on the dependent variable. When an interaction effect is present, the impact of one factor depends on the level of the other factor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(aov(t3 ~ diet * exercises, data = weightloss))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;               Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&amp;gt;F)    
diet            1   0.09    0.09   0.064    0.801

&lt;p&gt;As we can see here, the effect of the interaction is significant (&lt;code&gt;diet:exercises&lt;/code&gt;). This means that our two independent variables depend on each other and that the interaction between them has an effect on our dependent variable, i.e., weight loss (&lt;code&gt;t3&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, all of this probably sounds pretty familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “problem” comes when we realize that there are different ways to calculate the Sum of Squares, and therefore to compute these ANOVA models. Often, this is an unknown fact, but not only that, many widely used software for statistical analysis use different types of ANOVA by default (this is even less known), so we need to be careful about which ANOVA model we want to use, what software we are using, etc. Moreover, this can be even more confusing because &lt;strong&gt;if the data is balanced, the different types of ANOVA will give the same result, but they don’t in case of unbalanced data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are three types of ANOVA depending on how the Sum of Squares is done: ANOVA type I, II, and III.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;anova-type-i&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ANOVA Type I&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that characterizes this type of ANOVA is that the Sum of Squares is calculated sequentially, so the variation will be allocated to the different variables in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given our Two-Way ANOVA model (independent variables &lt;code&gt;diet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;exercises&lt;/code&gt;), this type of ANOVA will assign the maximum variation to the &lt;code&gt;diet&lt;/code&gt; variable, and the remaining variation to the &lt;code&gt;exercises&lt;/code&gt; variable and the residuals, in that order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(aov(t3 ~ diet + exercises, data = weightloss))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&amp;gt;F)    
diet         1   0.09    0.09   0.033    0.856

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(aov(t3 ~ exercises + diet, data = weightloss))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&amp;gt;F)    
exercises    1 116.66  116.66  42.697 5.01e-08 ***
diet         1   0.09    0.09   0.033    0.856

&lt;p&gt;We can see that the result doesn’t change if we flip the factors in the formula. This is because our data is balanced. Let’s remove some random samples and repeat the process…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;weightloss_unbal &amp;lt;- weightloss %&amp;gt;% 
  dplyr::sample_n(floor(nrow(.)*0.9)) # remove random 10%
  
summary(aov(t3 ~ diet + exercises, data = weightloss_unbal))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&amp;gt;F)

&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;summary(aov(t3 ~ exercises + diet, data = weightloss_unbal))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(&amp;gt;F)    
exercises    1 111.65  111.65   43.99 6.11e-08 ***
diet         1   0.76    0.76    0.30    0.587    
Residuals   40 101.51    2.54                     
---
Signif. codes:  0 &amp;#39;***&amp;#39; 0.001 &amp;#39;**&amp;#39; 0.01 &amp;#39;*&amp;#39; 0.05 &amp;#39;.&amp;#39; 0.1 &amp;#39; &amp;#39; 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we can appreciate differences in the results when we flip the order of factors! Remember that &lt;strong&gt;in ANOVA type I, the Sum of Squares is sequential, so the order matters!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of ANOVA is used by the &lt;strong&gt;R software&lt;/strong&gt; (by &lt;code&gt;aov()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;anova()&lt;/code&gt; functions). Therefore, if you use R in your analysis, keep in mind that the order of the independent variables in your formula matters, because if your data is not perfectly balanced, your result will change according to the order of variables. Finally, if your data is not balanced, maybe you should consider another type of ANOVA, and if you’re interested in computing other type of ANOVA in R, you can use the function &lt;code&gt;Anova()&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;car&lt;/code&gt; package, or &lt;code&gt;anova_test()&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;rstatix&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;anova-type-ii&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ANOVA Type II&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In ANOVA type II, the variation assigned to the first independent variable takes into account the second and vice versa. In addition, the Sum of Squares of ANOVA type II have no interaction effects. Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;we will only use this type of ANOVA when we have no interaction between our independent variables&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, when we are facing unbalanced data (and no interaction), this type of ANOVA is much better than the first type as we do not have to worry about the order of variables in our model. We see below (in R) as if we exchange the order of factors the result doesn’t change (as it did in the previous ANOVA type).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;r&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;mod &amp;lt;- lm(t3 ~ diet + exercises, data = weightloss_unbal)

&lt;p&gt;This type of ANOVA is the default type in &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;code&gt;statsmodels&lt;/code&gt; library), so if this is your software, well for you and less headaches!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;anova-type-iii&#34; class=&#34;section level1&#34;&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;ANOVA Type III&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last one is the ANOVA type III, also called partial Sum of Squares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like ANOVA type II, ANOVA type III Sum of Squares is not sequential, so the order of the independent variables doesn’t matter. However, unlike type II, type III allows an interaction effect between independent variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See below how ANOVA type III allows interaction and the result doesn’t change if we flip the independent factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of ANOVA is the default type in the &lt;strong&gt;SAS&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;SPSS&lt;/strong&gt; software. Although I mostly use R, this should be the default ANOVA type in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;If the data is balanced, the type of ANOVA doesn’t matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ANOVA type I should be used when there is a serious theoretical reason for it. Put the most important independent variable first and it will receive the maximum amount of variation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ANOVA type II should be used when we don’t expect a true interaction between independent variables&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ANOVA type III should be used when a true interaction between independent variables is expected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t be alarmed if your results do not match those of your colleague who is using other software, there is always an explanation&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>FOBI: An ontology to represent food intake data and associate it with metabolomic data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nutrition research can be conducted by using two complementary approaches: (i) traditional self-reporting methods or (ii) via metabolomics techniques to analyze food intake biomarkers in biofluids. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of these two very different types of data often hinder their analysis and integration. To manage this challenge, we have developed a novel ontology that describes food and their associated metabolite entities in a hierarchical way. This ontology uses a formal naming system, category definitions, properties and relations between both types of data. The ontology presented is called FOBI (Food-Biomarker Ontology) and it is composed of two interconnected sub-ontologies. One is a ’Food Ontology’ consisting of raw foods and ‘multi-component foods’ while the second is a ‘Biomarker Ontology’ containing food intake biomarkers classified by their chemical classes. These two sub-ontologies are conceptually independent but interconnected by different properties. This allows data and information regarding foods and food biomarkers to be visualized in a bidirectional way, going from metabolomics to nutritional data or vice versa. Potential applications of this ontology include the annotation of foods and biomarkers using a well-defined and consistent nomenclature, the standardized reporting of metabolomics workflows (e.g. metabolite identification, experimental design) or the application of different enrich- ment analysis approaches to analyze nutrimetabolomic data. Availability: FOBI is freely available in both OWL (Web Ontology Language) and OBO (Open Biomedical Ontolo- gies) formats at the project’s Github repository (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/FoodBiomarkerOntology&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/FoodBiomarkerOntology&lt;/a&gt;) and FOBI visualization tool is available in &lt;a href=&#34;https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/FOBI_Visualization_Tool/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/FOBI_Visualization_Tool/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mass spectrometry, like other high-throughput technologies, usually faces a data mining challenge to provide an understandable output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Often, statistical analysis is one of the hard points and it’s critical in the subsequent biological interpretation of the results. Due to this fact combined with the computational programming skills needed for this type of analysis, several bioinformatic tools have emerged to simplify mass spectrometry data analysis. However, sometimes the analysis is still limited to a few hidebound statistical methods and to a low-flexible datasets. POMAShiny is a web-based tool that provides a structured, flexible and user- friendly workflow for the visualization, exploratory and statistical analysis of mass spectrometry data. This tool integrates several statistical methods, some of them widely used in other type of omics, and it’s based on the POMA R/Bioconductor package, which increases the reproducibility and flexibility of analysis outside the web environment. POMAShiny and POMA are both freely available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/POMAShiny&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/POMAShiny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/POMA&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/POMA&lt;/a&gt; , respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Similarly to other high-throughput technologies, metabolomics usually faces a data mining challenge to provide an understandable and useful output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Biological interpretation of the results is one of the hard points and several bioinformatics tools have emerged to simplify and improve this step. However, sometimes these tools accept only very simplistic data structures and, for example, they do not even accept data with several covariates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POMA is a free, friendly and fast Shiny interface for analysing and visualization data after an analytical targeted metabolomics process and its hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/POMA/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/POMA/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POMA allows the user to go from the raw data to statistical analysis. The analysis is organized in three blocks: “Load Data” (where user can upload metabolite data and a covariates file), “Pre-processing” (value imputation and normalization) and “Statistical analysis” (univariate and multivariate methods, limma, correlation analysis, feature selection methods, random forest, etc.). These steps include multiple types of interactive data visualization integrated in an intuitive user interface that requires no programming skills. Finally, POMA also generates different automatic statistical and exploratory reports to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Epigenome-wide association study in Childhood Obesity: Searching for early markers of late disease risk</title>
      <link>/talk/epimet2019/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/talk/epimet2019/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rationale&lt;/strong&gt;: Childhood obesity is one a major Public Health
issue. Overweight/obese children have a high risk of being
obese as adults and develop other co-morbidities, including type
2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer.
It has been proposed that epigenetic mechanisms might be
involved in mediating long-term metabolic dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods&lt;/strong&gt;: Here we analyzed DNA methylation profiles (Infinium
MethylationEPIC BeadChip, 850K) in whole blood from 26
obese (zBMI &amp;gt; 2) and 12 control lean pre-pubertal children
(zBMI &amp;lt; 1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;:109 CpG sites appeared differentially methylated
between the two groups (methylation change 10% and FDR
value &amp;lt;0.05). 5 out of the 109 targets, were located within the
SPATC1L (Spermatogenesis and Centriole Associated 1 Like)
gene. Next, we performed a Two Sample Mendelian
Randomization test, and found that 2 of the 5 CpG sites
mapping the SPATC1L locus are causal for multiple disorders,
including childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, ulcerative colitis
and inflammatory bowel disease. SPATC1L expression was
similar in whole blood of obese and lean subjects. However, the
contiguous genes COL6A2 and COL6A3 (Collagen Type VI
Alpha 2 and 3 Chains), which are strongly associated to obesity,
were differentially expressed between the two groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;: Childhood obesity is associated to a small change
in DNA methylation (109 CpG sites). In our dataset, only 2 CpG
sites appeared to play a causative role in the development of
the disease. We hypothesize that these CpG sites might
mediate disease risk by modulating the expression of physically
close genes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FBOnto: An ontology to represent food intake data and associate it with metabolomic data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Currently, nutrition research generates a lot of complex data hard to analyze and associate with other data or omics such as metabolomics. By itself, metabolomics is closely linked to nutrition. However, it is still difficult to associate these two types of data. One reason for this difficulty is the heterogeneity found in the information provided by participants in nutritional studies about what they have eaten. In order to
manage this heterogeneity we have decide to build an ontology, describing foods in a
hierarchichal way that enables a common description of food intake. This ontology
contains formal naming, definition of the categories, properties, and relations
between the concepts of two types of data, food and related metabolites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ontology has been created using Protégé 5.2.0 version. As is common in
ontologies, FBOnto (Food-Biomarker Ontology) has been written in OWL language (Web
Ontology Language).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ontology presented is called FBOnto and is made of two sub-ontologies. The first
ontology describes foods: from simple such as fruits and vegetables to more complex
foods such as ratatouille. The second ontology describes metabolites, grouped in their
different chemical classes. The nodes or elements of these two sub-ontologies are
connected by the properties of each one, so that if a metabolite is in different foods, it
will connect with all of them. This ontology allows us to visualize data in a
bidirectional way, going from metabolomics to nutritional data or vice versa. In
addition, this ontology can also be useful for other analyses such as enrichment analysis
or a novel concept, food-enrichment analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
