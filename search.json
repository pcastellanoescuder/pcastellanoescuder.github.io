By itself, metabolomics is closely linked to nutrition. However, it is still difficult to associate these two types of data. One reason for this difficulty is the heterogeneity found in the information provided by participants in nutritional studies about what they have eaten. In order to manage this heterogeneity we have decide to build an ontology, describing foods in a hierarchichal way that enables a common description of food intake.","tags":[],"title":"FBOnto: An ontology to represent food intake data and associate it with metabolomic data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["María Leal-Witt","Marina Llobet","Sara Samino","Pol Castellano","Daniel Cuadras","Josep Jiménez-Chillarón","ÓscarvYanes","Marta Ramon-Krauel","Carles Lerin"],"categories":null,"date":1531000800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531000800,"objectID":"64da7eea240272a755dc1d8d415c115d","permalink":"/publication/obesity_carles_2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-08T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/obesity_carles_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Lifestyle intervention decreases urine trimethylamine N-oxide levels in prepubertal children with obesity","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"date":1517526000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1517526000,"objectID":"9819cf8398f2bed53b8c6ecc588eee69","permalink":"/talk/metnet-talk/","publishdate":"2018-02-02T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/metnet-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"Childhood obesity is one a major Public Health issue.
