And yes, they can give different outputs depending on the data.\nANOVA is a widely used statistical method used to test the effect of one or more factorial variables (independent terms) on a continuous numerical variable (dependent term). This method aims to split the total variation of the dependent variable into one or more sources of variation using the Sum of Squares, and unveiling if independent variables have a significant effect on the dependent variable. There are three basic assumptions in ANOVA:\n Independence of samples The distribution of the residuals should be normal Homocedasticity: homogeneity of the variances  In case of testing the effect of only one independent variable, we will be using the One-Way ANOVA. However, if we want to test two independent variables, we will use the Two-Way ANOVA. In the same way, if we want to test the effect of three or more factorial independent variables, we will call it X-Way ANOVA.\nFor example, we want to assess the effects of diet and exercises on weight loss in 10 sedentary males. Fortunately, the data for this experiment can be found in the datarium R package. Here, our factorial independent variables are diet and exercises, and our dependent numeric variable is the weight loss score measured at the end of each trial (t3). For more info about the dataset see ?datarium::weightloss.\nlibrary(tidyverse) library(datarium) data(weightloss) head(weightloss)  # A tibble: 6 × 6 id diet exercises t1 t2 t3 \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 1 1 no no 10.4 13.2 11.6 2 2 no no 11.6 10.7 13.2 3 3 no no 11.4 11.1 11.4 4 4 no no 11.1 9.5 11.1 5 5 no no 9.5 9.73 12.3 6 6 no no 9.5 12.7 10.4  Now, we can try to answer different questions given this dataset and the above concepts.\nOne-Way ANOVA  What is the effect of the diet on the weight loss score without regard to exercises?  summary(aov(t3 ~ diet, data = weightloss))   Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) diet 1 0.09 0.091 0.017 0.895 Residuals 46 239.61 5.209  Seems that diet alone doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a significant effect on weight loss.\n What is the effect of the exercises on the weight loss score without regard to diet?  summary(aov(t3 ~ exercises, data = weightloss))   Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) exercises 1 116.7 116.66 43.61 3.58e-08 *** Residuals 46 123.0 2.67 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  On the contrary, seems that exercises have a significant effect on weight loss.\nTwo-Way ANOVA  Is there a unique effect of the diet or exercises on the weight loss score (t3)?  summary(aov(t3 ~ diet + exercises, data = weightloss))   Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) diet 1 0.09 0.09 0.033 0.856 exercises 1 116.66 116.66 42.697 5.01e-08 *** Residuals 45 122.95 2.73 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  Given these results, there seems to be an effect of exercises but not diet on weight loss.\n Does the effect of the diet depend on the exercises? Here we need an interaction term (*). Interaction effects represent the combined effects of factors on the dependent variable. When an interaction effect is present, the impact of one factor depends on the level of the other factor.  summary(aov(t3 ~ diet * exercises, data = weightloss))   Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) diet 1 0.09 0.09 0.064 0.801 exercises 1 116.66 116.66 82.493 1.19e-11 *** diet:exercises 1 60.73 60.73 42.943 5.18e-08 *** Residuals 44 62.22 1.41 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  As we can see here, the effect of the interaction is significant (diet:exercises). This means that our two independent variables depend on each other and that the interaction between them has an effect on our dependent variable, i.e., weight loss (t3).\nSo far, all of this probably sounds pretty familiar.\nThe \u0026ldquo;problem\u0026rdquo; comes when we realize that there are different ways to calculate the Sum of Squares, and therefore to compute these ANOVA models. Often, this is an unknown fact, but not only that, many widely used software for statistical analysis use different types of ANOVA by default (this is even less known), so we need to be careful about which ANOVA model we want to use, what software we are using, etc. Moreover, this can be even more confusing because if the data is balanced, the different types of ANOVA will give the same result, but they don\u0026rsquo;t in case of unbalanced data.\nThere are three types of ANOVA depending on how the Sum of Squares is done: ANOVA type I, II, and III.\nANOVA Type I The fact that characterizes this type of ANOVA is that the Sum of Squares is calculated sequentially, so the variation will be allocated to the different variables in order.\nGiven our Two-Way ANOVA model (independent variables diet and exercises), this type of ANOVA will assign the maximum variation to the diet variable, and the remaining variation to the exercises variable and the residuals, in that order.\nsummary(aov(t3 ~ diet + exercises, data = weightloss))   Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) diet 1 0.09 0.09 0.033 0.856 exercises 1 116.66 116.66 42.697 5.01e-08 *** Residuals 45 122.95 2.73 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  summary(aov(t3 ~ exercises + diet, data = weightloss))   Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) exercises 1 116.66 116.66 42.697 5.01e-08 *** diet 1 0.09 0.09 0.033 0.856 Residuals 45 122.95 2.73 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  We can see that the result doesn\u0026rsquo;t change if we flip the factors in the formula. This is because our data is balanced. Let\u0026rsquo;s remove some random samples and repeat the process\u0026hellip;\nweightloss_unbal \u0026lt;- weightloss %\u0026gt;% dplyr::sample_n(floor(nrow(.)*0.9)) # remove random 10% summary(aov(t3 ~ diet + exercises, data = weightloss_unbal))   Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) diet 1 0.0 0.00 0.00 0.987 exercises 1 101.3 101.33 35.57 5.31e-07 *** Residuals 40 113.9 2.85 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  summary(aov(t3 ~ exercises + diet, data = weightloss_unbal))   Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) exercises 1 101.26 101.26 35.547 5.34e-07 *** diet 1 0.07 0.07 0.025 0.875 Residuals 40 113.94 2.85 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  Now, we can appreciate differences in the results when we flip the order of factors! Remember that in ANOVA type I, the Sum of Squares is sequential, so the order matters!\nThis type of ANOVA is used by the R software (by aov() and anova() functions). Therefore, if you use R in your analysis, keep in mind that the order of the independent variables in your formula matters, because if your data is not perfectly balanced, your result will change according to the order of variables. Finally, if your data is not balanced, maybe you should consider another type of ANOVA, and if you\u0026rsquo;re interested in computing other type of ANOVA in R, you can use the function Anova() from the car package, or anova_test() from the rstatix package.\nANOVA Type II In ANOVA type II, the variation assigned to the first independent variable takes into account the second and vice versa. In addition, the Sum of Squares of ANOVA type II have no interaction effects. Therefore, we will only use this type of ANOVA when we have no interaction between our independent variables.\nThus, when we are facing unbalanced data (and no interaction), this type of ANOVA is much better than the first type as we do not have to worry about the order of variables in our model. We see below (in R) as if we exchange the order of factors the result doesn\u0026rsquo;t change (as it did in the previous ANOVA type).\nmod \u0026lt;- lm(t3 ~ diet + exercises, data = weightloss_unbal) car::Anova(mod, type = \u0026quot;II\u0026quot;)  Anova Table (Type II tests) Response: t3 Sum Sq Df F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) diet 0.072 1 0.0252 0.8745 exercises 101.327 1 35.5723 5.306e-07 *** Residuals 113.939 40 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  mod2 \u0026lt;- lm(t3 ~ exercises + diet, data = weightloss_unbal) car::Anova(mod2, type = \u0026quot;II\u0026quot;)  Anova Table (Type II tests) Response: t3 Sum Sq Df F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) exercises 101.327 1 35.5723 5.306e-07 *** diet 0.072 1 0.0252 0.8745 Residuals 113.939 40 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  This type of ANOVA is the default type in Python (statsmodels library), so if this is your software, well for you and less headaches!\nANOVA Type III The last one is the ANOVA type III, also called partial Sum of Squares.\nLike ANOVA type II, ANOVA type III Sum of Squares is not sequential, so the order of the independent variables doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. However, unlike type II, type III allows an interaction effect between independent variables.\nSee below how ANOVA type III allows interaction and the result doesn\u0026rsquo;t change if we flip the independent factors.\nmod3 \u0026lt;- lm(t3 ~ diet * exercises, data = weightloss_unbal) car::Anova(mod3, type = \u0026quot;III\u0026quot;)  Anova Table (Type III tests) Response: t3 Sum Sq Df F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) (Intercept) 1288.91 1 868.648 \u0026lt; 2.2e-16 *** diet 30.76 1 20.732 5.071e-05 *** exercises 153.50 1 103.450 1.580e-12 *** diet:exercises 56.07 1 37.788 3.234e-07 *** Residuals 57.87 39 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  mod4 \u0026lt;- lm(t3 ~ exercises * diet, data = weightloss_unbal) car::Anova(mod4, type = \u0026quot;III\u0026quot;)  Anova Table (Type III tests) Response: t3 Sum Sq Df F value Pr(\u0026gt;F) (Intercept) 1288.91 1 868.648 \u0026lt; 2.2e-16 *** exercises 153.50 1 103.450 1.580e-12 *** diet 30.76 1 20.732 5.071e-05 *** exercises:diet 56.07 1 37.788 3.234e-07 *** Residuals 57.87 39 --- Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1  This type of ANOVA is the default type in the SAS and SPSS software.

Put the most important independent variable first and it will receive the maximum amount of variation ANOVA type II should be used when we don\u0026rsquo;t expect a true interaction between independent variables ANOVA type III should be used when a true interaction between independent variables is expected Don\u0026rsquo;t be alarmed if your results do not match those of your colleague who is using other software, there is always an explanation  ","date":1650412800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650412800,"objectID":"18216aa9be3042892c09f04bffdd21cb","permalink":"/post/anova/","publishdate":"2022-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/anova/","section":"post","summary":"Know the differences between different ANOVA types","tags":null,"title":"ANOVA types in a nutshell","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1628222400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628222400,"objectID":"5e0eab630947fcc6180f798ae99fef8b","permalink":"/talk/bioc2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-06T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/bioc2021/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"POMA: A user-friendly workflow for metabolomics and proteomics data analysis","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Pol Castellano-Escuder","Raúl González-Domínguez","Francesc Carmona-Pontaque","Cristina Andrés-Lacueva","Alex Sánchez-Pla"],"categories":null,"content":"Metabolomics and proteomics, like other omics domains, usually face a data mining challenge in providing an understandable output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine.

Next, we performed a Two Sample Mendelian Randomization test, and found that 2 of the 5 CpG sites mapping the SPATC1L locus are causal for multiple disorders, including childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease. SPATC1L expression was similar in whole blood of obese and lean subjects. However, the contiguous genes COL6A2 and COL6A3 (Collagen Type VI Alpha 2 and 3 Chains), which are strongly associated to obesity, were differentially expressed between the two groups.\nDiscussion: Childhood obesity is associated to a small change in DNA methylation (109 CpG sites).

By itself, metabolomics is closely linked to nutrition. However, it is still difficult to associate these two types of data. One reason for this difficulty is the heterogeneity found in the information provided by participants in nutritional studies about what they have eaten. In order to manage this heterogeneity we have decide to build an ontology, describing foods in a hierarchichal way that enables a common description of food intake. This ontology contains formal naming, definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts of two types of data, food and related metabolites.\nThis ontology has been created using Protégé 5.2.0 version. As is common in ontologies, FBOnto (Food-Biomarker Ontology) has been written in OWL language (Web Ontology Language).\nThe ontology presented is called FBOnto and is made of two sub-ontologies. The first ontology describes foods: from simple such as fruits and vegetables to more complex foods such as ratatouille. The second ontology describes metabolites, grouped in their different chemical classes. The nodes or elements of these two sub-ontologies are connected by the properties of each one, so that if a metabolite is in different foods, it will connect with all of them. This ontology allows us to visualize data in a bidirectional way, going from metabolomics to nutritional data or vice versa. In addition, this ontology can also be useful for other analyses such as enrichment analysis or a novel concept, food-enrichment analysis.\n","date":1545282000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545282000,"objectID":"551196003f85346c5bb2641aea87c0e6","permalink":"/talk/jbg2018/","publishdate":"2018-12-20T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/jbg2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Currently, nutrition research generates a lot of complex data hard to analyze and associate with other data or omics such as metabolomics.

We studied 34 prepubertal children with obesity before and after a 6- month-long lifestyle intervention program. We applied a nuclear magnetic resonance approach to obtain the metabolomic profile from urine samples. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to achieve group classification and variable importance on projection (VIP) for biomarker selection.\nResults: The intervention reduced caloric intake by 10% (p\u0026lt;0.05) and BMI-SDS by 0.47 SD (p\u0026lt;0.001). PLS-DA identified trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO, VIP=2.21) as the metabolite with the highest discrimination properties between groups. Urine TMAO levels were reduced after the intervention (p\u0026lt;0.05). TMAO is a biomarker of cardiovascular disease risk and is a product of gut microbiota-dependent metabolism of certain dietary compounds, including choline. Notably, changes in TMAO levels after the intervention did not correlate to differences in choline intake but were inversely associated with fiber intake (p\u0026lt;0.05).\nConclusions: Our results indicate that TMAO levels are decreased by lifestyle intervention in children with obesity.\n","date":1531022400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531022400,"objectID":"9d8c337b44458b9b94218ed4563086e4","permalink":"/publication/obesity_2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-08T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/obesity_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective: Early lifestyle interventions in children with obesity decrease risk of future obesity and metabolic disorders.
