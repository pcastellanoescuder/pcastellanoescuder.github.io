Overweight/obese children have a high risk of being obese as adults and develop other co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer. It has been proposed that epigenetic mechanisms might be involved in mediating long-term metabolic dysfunction.\nMethods: Here we analyzed DNA methylation profiles (Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip, 850K) in whole blood from 26 obese (zBMI \u0026gt; 2) and 12 control lean pre-pubertal children (zBMI \u0026lt; 1).\nResults:109 CpG sites appeared differentially methylated between the two groups (methylation change 10% and FDR value \u0026lt;0.05). 5 out of the 109 targets, were located within the SPATC1L (Spermatogenesis and Centriole Associated 1 Like) gene. Next, we performed a Two Sample Mendelian Randomization test, and found that 2 of the 5 CpG sites mapping the SPATC1L locus are causal for multiple disorders, including childhood obesity, type 2 diabetes, ulcerative colitis and inflammatory bowel disease. SPATC1L expression was similar in whole blood of obese and lean subjects. However, the contiguous genes COL6A2 and COL6A3 (Collagen Type VI Alpha 2 and 3 Chains), which are strongly associated to obesity, were differentially expressed between the two groups.\nDiscussion: Childhood obesity is associated to a small change in DNA methylation (109 CpG sites). In our dataset, only 2 CpG sites appeared to play a causative role in the development of the disease. We hypothesize that these CpG sites might mediate disease risk by modulating the expression of physically close genes.\n","date":1547593200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547593200,"objectID":"c19d21e0533636aa67951d57fbfb1f6b","permalink":"/talk/epimet-talk/","publishdate":"2019-01-16T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/epimet-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"Rationale: Childhood obesity is one a major Public Health issue.

By itself, metabolomics is closely linked to nutrition. However, it is still difficult to associate these two types of data. One reason for this difficulty is the heterogeneity found in the information provided by participants in nutritional studies about what they have eaten. In order to manage this heterogeneity we have decide to build an ontology, describing foods in a hierarchichal way that enables a common description of food intake. This ontology contains formal naming, definition of the categories, properties, and relations between the concepts of two types of data, food and related metabolites.\nThis ontology has been created using Protégé 5.2.0 version. As is common in ontologies, FBOnto (Food-Biomarker Ontology) has been written in OWL language (Web Ontology Language).\nThe ontology presented is called FBOnto and is made of two sub-ontologies. The first ontology describes foods: from simple such as fruits and vegetables to more complex foods such as ratatouille. The second ontology describes metabolites, grouped in their different chemical classes. The nodes or elements of these two sub-ontologies are connected by the properties of each one, so that if a metabolite is in different foods, it will connect with all of them. This ontology allows us to visualize data in a bidirectional way, going from metabolomics to nutritional data or vice versa. In addition, this ontology can also be useful for other analyses such as enrichment analysis or a novel concept, food-enrichment analysis.\n","date":1545260400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545260400,"objectID":"1ec9d008ced306b6f1d3f24a7c79c557","permalink":"/talk/fbonto_bio-talk/","publishdate":"2018-12-20T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/fbonto_bio-talk/","section":"talk","summary":"Currently, nutrition research generates a lot of complex data hard to analyze and associate with other data or omics such as metabolomics.

However, the metabolic effects of such interventions are not completely characterized.\nMethods: We analyzed the impact of lifestyle intervention in the urine metabolome from prepubertal children. We studied 34 prepubertal children with obesity before and after a 6- month-long lifestyle intervention program. We applied a nuclear magnetic resonance approach to obtain the metabolomic profile from urine samples. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to achieve group classification and variable importance on projection (VIP) for biomarker selection.\nResults: The intervention reduced caloric intake by 10% (p\u0026lt;0.05) and BMI-SDS by 0.47 SD (p\u0026lt;0.001). PLS-DA identified trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO, VIP=2.21) as the metabolite with the highest discrimination properties between groups. Urine TMAO levels were reduced after the intervention (p\u0026lt;0.05). TMAO is a biomarker of cardiovascular disease risk and is a product of gut microbiota-dependent metabolism of certain dietary compounds, including choline. Notably, changes in TMAO levels after the intervention did not correlate to differences in choline intake but were inversely associated with fiber intake (p\u0026lt;0.05).\nConclusions: Our results indicate that TMAO levels are decreased by lifestyle intervention in children with obesity.\n","date":1531000800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531000800,"objectID":"64da7eea240272a755dc1d8d415c115d","permalink":"/publication/obesity_carles_2018/","publishdate":"2018-07-08T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/obesity_carles_2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective: Early lifestyle interventions in children with obesity decrease risk of future obesity and metabolic disorders.
