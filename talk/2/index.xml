      <description>Similarly to other high-throughput technologies, metabolomics usually faces a data mining challenge to provide an understandable and useful output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Biological interpretation of the results is one of the hard points and several bioinformatics tools have emerged to simplify and improve this step. However, sometimes these tools accept only very simplistic data structures and, for example, they do not even accept data with several covariates.</description>

      <title>Epigenome-wide association study in childhood obesity</title>

      <description>Childhood obesity is one a major Public Health issue. Overweight/obese children have a high risk of being obese as adults and develop other co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer. It has been proposed that epigenetic mechanisms might be involved in mediating long-term metabolic dysfunction.
Here we analyzed DNA methylation profiles (Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850K) in whole blood from 26 obese (zBMI &amp;gt; 2) and 12 control lean pre-pubertal children (zBMI &amp;lt; 1).</description>
