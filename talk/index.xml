      <title>FOBI: An ontology to represent food intake data and associate it with metabolomic data</title>

      <description>Nutrition research can be conducted by using two complementary approaches: 1) traditional self-reporting methods or 2) via metabolomics techniques to analyze food intake biomarkers in biofluids. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of these two very different types of data often hinder their analysis and integration. To manage this challenge, we have developed a novel ontology that describes food and their associated metabolite entities in a hierarchical way. This ontology uses a formal naming system, category definitions, properties and relations between both types of data.</description>

      <title>POMA: Shiny Framework Statistical analysis tool for targeted metabolomic data</title>

      <description>Similarly to other high-throughput technologies, metabolomics usually faces a data mining challenge to provide an understandable and useful output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Biological interpretation of the results is one of the hard points and several bioinformatics tools have emerged to simplify and improve this step. However, sometimes these tools accept only very simplistic data structures and, for example, they do not even accept data with several covariates.</description>

      <title>Epigenome-wide association study in Childhood Obesity: Searching for early markers of late disease risk</title>

      <description>Rationale: Childhood obesity is one a major Public Health issue. Overweight/obese children have a high risk of being obese as adults and develop other co-morbidities, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and several types of cancer. It has been proposed that epigenetic mechanisms might be involved in mediating long-term metabolic dysfunction.
Methods: Here we analyzed DNA methylation profiles (Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip, 850K) in whole blood from 26 obese (zBMI &amp;gt; 2) and 12 control lean pre-pubertal children (zBMI &amp;lt; 1).</description>

      <title>FBOnto: An ontology to represent food intake data and associate it with metabolomic data</title>

      <description>Currently, nutrition research generates a lot of complex data hard to analyze and associate with other data or omics such as metabolomics. By itself, metabolomics is closely linked to nutrition. However, it is still difficult to associate these two types of data. One reason for this difficulty is the heterogeneity found in the information provided by participants in nutritional studies about what they have eaten. In order to manage this heterogeneity we have decide to build an ontology, describing foods in a hierarchichal way that enables a common description of food intake.</description>
