      <title>FOBI: an ontology to represent food intake data and associate it with metabolomic data</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nutrition research can be conducted by using two complementary approaches: (i) traditional self-reporting methods or (ii) via metabolomics techniques to analyze food intake biomarkers in biofluids. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of these two very different types of data often hinder their analysis and integration. To manage this challenge, we have developed a novel ontology that describes food and their associated metabolite entities in a hierarchical way. This ontology uses a formal naming system, category definitions, properties and relations between both types of data. The ontology presented is called FOBI (Food-Biomarker Ontology) and it is composed of two interconnected sub-ontologies. One is a ’Food Ontology’ consisting of raw foods and ‘multi-component foods’ while the second is a ‘Biomarker Ontology’ containing food intake biomarkers classified by their chemical classes. These two sub-ontologies are conceptually independent but interconnected by different properties. This allows data and information regarding foods and food biomarkers to be visualized in a bidirectional way, going from metabolomics to nutritional data or vice versa. Potential applications of this ontology include the annotation of foods and biomarkers using a well-defined and consistent nomenclature, the standardized reporting of metabolomics workflows (e.g. metabolite identification, experimental design) or the application of different enrich- ment analysis approaches to analyze nutrimetabolomic data. Availability: FOBI is freely available in both OWL (Web Ontology Language) and OBO (Open Biomedical Ontolo- gies) formats at the project’s Github repository (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/FoodBiomarkerOntology&#34;&gt;https://github.com/pcastellanoescuder/FoodBiomarkerOntology&lt;/a&gt;) and FOBI visualization tool is available in &lt;a href=&#34;https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/FOBI_Visualization_Tool/&#34;&gt;https://polcastellano.shinyapps.io/FOBI_Visualization_Tool/&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lifestyle intervention decreases urine trimethylamine N-oxide levels in prepubertal children with obesity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; Early lifestyle interventions in children with obesity decrease risk of future obesity
and metabolic disorders. However, the metabolic effects of such interventions are not
completely characterized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methods:&lt;/strong&gt; We analyzed the impact of lifestyle intervention in the urine metabolome from
prepubertal children. We studied 34 prepubertal children with obesity before and after a 6-
month-long lifestyle intervention program. We applied a nuclear magnetic resonance approach
to obtain the metabolomic profile from urine samples. Partial Least Squares-Discriminant
Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to achieve group classification and variable importance on
projection (VIP) for biomarker selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Results:&lt;/strong&gt; The intervention reduced caloric intake by 10% (p&amp;lt;0.05) and BMI-SDS by 0.47 SD
(p&amp;lt;0.001). PLS-DA identified trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO, VIP=2.21) as the metabolite with
the highest discrimination properties between groups. Urine TMAO levels were reduced after
the intervention (p&amp;lt;0.05). TMAO is a biomarker of cardiovascular disease risk and is a product
of gut microbiota-dependent metabolism of certain dietary compounds, including choline.
Notably, changes in TMAO levels after the intervention did not correlate to differences in choline
intake but were inversely associated with fiber intake (p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/strong&gt; Our results indicate that TMAO levels are decreased by lifestyle intervention in
children with obesity.&lt;/p&gt;
